# Case Study: Analyzing Company Fundamentals for Strategic Financial Insights

## Background

This case study leverages historical price data and fundamental financial metrics for S&P 500 companies to explore patterns in stock behavior and shareholder equity management. The dataset provides a comprehensive view of how variables like Net Income, Total Revenue, Assets, and Liabilities interact to influence key financial outcomes such as Estimated Shares Outstanding (ESO).

In the financial industry, trading and investment strategies are increasingly influenced by algorithms and automated systems. It is estimated that nearly 30% of stock market trading traffic is generated by machines, a figure that is rapidly growing. This shift has led to a critical question for industry stakeholders:

### Can trading be fully automated?

While many aspects of trading can be algorithmically managed, the nuances of financial decision-making still require human oversight and strategic judgment. Analyzing historical data like the one used in this project can help pinpoint where human intervention is still vital and how predictive models can complement these efforts.

This project uses fundamental data—metrics that reflect a company's underlying financial health—to assess the drivers of Estimated Shares Outstanding (ESO), which is crucial for understanding stock dilution, investor value, and corporate financing decisions. By examining how these financial variables interrelate, the model can support both automated and human-driven decisions around equity management, stock issuance, and capital allocation.
